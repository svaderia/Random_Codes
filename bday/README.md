# Paradox
In probability theory, the birthday problem or birthday paradox concerns the probability that, in a set of {\displaystyle n} n randomly chosen people, some pair of them will have the same birthday. By the pigeonhole principle, the probability reaches 100% when the number of people reaches 367 (since there are only 366 possible birthdays, including February 29). However, 99.9% probability is reached with just 70 people, and 50% probability with 23 people. These conclusions are based on the assumption that each day of the year (except February 29) is equally probable for a birthday.

## Functions
* `genBday(n)`: This function will randomly generates Birthday of `n` people.
* `getProbability(n, T)`: This function takes no.of people as `n` and number of Trials as `T` and returns the probability.

## Compatibility
This code is compatible with both `Python2` and `Python3`.
